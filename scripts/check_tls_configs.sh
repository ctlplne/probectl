# unified-TLS gate (Sprint 12 — WIRE-005/WIRE-007): every probectl listener and
# probectl↔probectl client takes its TLS policy from internal/crypto (the ONE
# hardened config; TLS 1.3 floor server-side). A bespoke `tls.Config{...}`
# literal outside internal/crypto is how a weak receiver config sneaks back in
# (the original WIRE-005: OTLP/MCP had default cipher suites) — this gate
# fails the build on any new one.
#
# Deliberate allowlist (OUTBOUND probe/integration clients speaking to
# THIRD-PARTY endpoints, where a 1.3-only floor would break legitimate
# monitoring targets; each keeps cert validation on and a 1.2 floor):
#   internal/canary/http.go   — operator-monitored HTTPS targets
#   internal/canary/dns.go    — DoT/DoH resolvers
#   internal/device/gnmi.go   — network devices (gNMI)
